NLP Tests
=========
This is a playground for my Ruby on Rails and NLP tests using the Treat Ruby library.  https://github.com/louismullie/treat  For the first pass, the system will automatically do key term extration of a set of texts as well as a simple classification on documents by industry, topic and location.
